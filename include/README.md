# Include File Definition

This crate defines the include file for the fuzzer for harnessing C code. The C header
can be generated by running:

```sh
rustup run nightly cbindgen --config cbindgen.toml --crate include --output tsffs.h
```

You need to install a fork of `cbindgen` that supports multiline annotations. You can
install it with:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/novafacing/cbindgen \
    --branch allow-equals-in-annotations cbindgen
```
